to edit stuff these will help:

* beautiful soup docs: <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/>
* also ScrapeNFeed is originally from here: <https://www.crummy.com/software/ScrapeNFeed/>
    * i copied it in b/c some of the imports didn't work with python3.6 - otherwise I think it's how I found it on GH

see fpm.py for an example

run with `python3 fpm.py` (or whatever new script you create)
